This is a fork of https://github.com/RandomGamer123/discord.py-unofficial and should only be used with the [RedV2 repo on my profile](https://github.com/aikaterna/RedV2). I will not be officially supporting this code and it uses the `discord` package namespace so be warned that it will conflict with discord.py proper.
